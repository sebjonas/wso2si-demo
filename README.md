# Getting started

## Download
Download the **Streaming Integrator Tooling** ZIP-archive distribution from [WSO2 Streaming Integrator site](https://wso2.com/integration/streaming-integrator/) (click **Tooling** button) and extract it to a location of your choice. Hereafter, the extracted location is referred to as <SIT_HOME>.

## Run
Start the **Streaming Integrator Tooling** by issuing one of the following commands from the <SIT_HOME>/bin directory.

* For Windows: ```streaming-integrator-tooling.bat```
* For Linux: ```./streaming-integrator-tooling.sh```

## Open
Access the **Streaming Integrator Tooling** via [http://localhost:9390/editor](http://localhost:9390/editor). The Streaming Integrator Tooling opens as shown below.

![streaming-integrator-tooling-welcome-page](/img/streaming-integrator-tooling-welcome-page.png)

## App
On the Welcome page click **New** then copy and paste the code below into the editor, then save it as 'FraudulentCardUse'.

```
@App:name("FraudulentCardUse")
@App:description("Detect fraudulent use of a credit card.")

define stream TradeStream(creditCardNo string, amount double);

@sink(type='log')
define stream SuspiciousTradeStream(creditCardNo string, totalAmount double, totalCount long);

@info(name='SuspiciousTrade')
from TradeStream#window.time(20 sec)
select 
    creditCardNo, 
    sum(amount) as totalAmount,
    count(creditCardNo) as totalCount
group by creditCardNo 
having totalAmount > 10000.0 and totalCount > 3
insert into SuspiciousTradeStream;
```

Events subscribed to from the trade stream where they will be grouped by credit card number and if the total amount is more than 1000 and total number of events are more than 3 - all within a 20 seconds time period - then a new event will be created and inserted to the suspicious trade stream.

## Execute
From the **Streaming Integrator Tooling** menu click **Run**.

## Simulate
Configure random event simulation as follows:
1. Click on **Event Simulator** (double arrows on left tab)
2. Click **Feed Simulation -> Create**
3. Give a name (Or the default name in the place holder will be used as its name)
4. Select **Random** as the Simulation Source
5. Click on **Add Simulation Source**
6. Select **FraudulentCardUse** as Siddhi App Name
7. Select **TradesStream** as StreamName
8. For **creditCardNo** change config type to **Regex based** and give the pattern as **143-90099-2343[0-9]{1}**.
9. Keep **Primitive Based** as the config type for **amount** but change from **100** to less than **1000** with *1* decimal.
10. Save the simulator configuration
11. The newly created simulator would be listed under *Active Feed Simulations** of **Feed Simulation** tab
12. Click on the **start** button (Arrow symbol) next to the newly created simulator

## View
See the input and respective output on the console. The output reflects the fraudulent transactions, aggregated over the last 20 seconds.

# Kafka
Let's add Kafka as source and sink for the **TradeStream** and the **SuspiciousTradeStream**.

## Download
Download the Kafka broker from the [Apache site](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/streaming-integrator/quick-start-guide/quick-start-guide/) and extract it. This directory is referred to as <KAFKA_HOME> from here on.

## Run
Let's start the Kafka server and create a Kafka topic so that the **FraudulentCardUse** Siddhi application you created can subscribe and publish its output to it.

To start Kafka:
1. Navigate to the <KAFKA_HOME> directory and start a zookeeper node by issuing the following command.
    ```sh bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties```
2. Navigate to the <KAFKA_HOME> directory and start Kafka server node by issuing the following command.
    ```sh bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties```

To create a Kafka topic named **trade-stream** and another named **suspicious-trade-stream**:
1. Navigate to <KAFKA_HOME> directory and issue the following command:
    ```bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic trade-stream```
2. Navigate to <KAFKA_HOME> directory and issue the following command:
    ```bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic suspicious-trade-stream```

Start the **Streaming Integrator Tooling** by issuing one of the following commands from the <SIT_HOME>/bin directory.

* For Windows: ```streaming-integrator-tooling.bat```
* For Linux: ```./streaming-integrator-tooling.sh```

## App
Open the **FraudulentCardUse** Siddhi app.

Add a **source** for the TradeStream definition:

```
@source(type='kafka',
        topic.list='trade-stream',
        partition.no.list='0',
        threading.option='single.thread',
        group.id="group",
        bootstrap.servers='localhost:9092',
        @map(type='json'))
```

Add a **sink** for the SuspiciousTradeStream definition:

```
@sink(type='kafka',
      topic='suspicious-trade-stream',
      bootstrap.servers='localhost:9092',
      partition.no='0',
      @map(type='json'))
```

The modified app looks like this:

```
@App:name("FraudulentCardUse")
@App:description("Detect fraudulent use of a credit card.")

@source(type='kafka',
        topic.list='trade-stream',
        partition.no.list='0',
        threading.option='single.thread',
        group.id="group",
        bootstrap.servers='localhost:9092',
        @map(type='json'))
define stream TradeStream(creditCardNo string, amount double);

@sink(type='kafka',
      topic='suspicious-trade-stream',
      bootstrap.servers='localhost:9092',
      partition.no='0',
      @map(type='json'))
@sink(type='log')
define stream SuspiciousTradeStream(creditCardNo string, totalAmount double, totalCount long);

@info(name='SuspiciousTrade')
from TradeStream#window.time(20 sec)
select 
    creditCardNo, 
    sum(amount) as totalAmount,
    count(creditCardNo) as totalCount
group by creditCardNo 
having totalAmount > 10000.0 and totalCount > 3
insert into SuspiciousTradeStream;
```

## Execute
From the **Streaming Integrator Tooling** menu click **Run**.

## Consume
1. Navigate to <KAFKA_HOME> directory and issue the following command:
    ```bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic suspicious-trade-stream```

## Simulate

1. Navigate to <KAFKA_HOME> directory and issue the following command:
    ```bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic trade-stream```
2. Paste in the following sequence of events:
    - ```[{"event": {"creditCardNo":"143-90099-23431", "amount":5000.0}}]```
    - ```[{"event": {"creditCardNo":"143-90099-23431", "amount":4000.0}}]```
    - ```[{"event": {"creditCardNo":"143-90099-23431", "amount":3000.0}}]```

## View
The expected outcome in the **suspicious-trade-stream** topic:
```
{"event":{"creditCardNo":"143-90099-23431","totalAmount":12000.0,"totalCount":3}}
```
You can also run the [Feed Simulation](#simulate) again and view the results in the Kafka consumer terminal. 

## Stop

Stop the running services:
1. Stop the Siddhi app and press ctrl-C in the terminal where you started Streaming Integrator Tooling
2. Press ctrl-C in the terminals running Kafka producer and consumer
3. Press ctrl-C in the terminals running Kafka and Zookeeper (in that order)

#RDMS

Let's join the trade stream with data in a database table. This application demonstrates how to perform join on streaming data with the data stored in RDBMS. The sample depicts a scenario, where a transaction by a credit card with which fraudulent activity has been previously done. The credit card numbers, which were noted for fraudulent activities are stored in an RDBMS table.
